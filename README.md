## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Focus Keeper:
    -   Ability to toggle between focus modes
    -   Allows users to limit what apps they use while in focus mode

### Not Evil Sudoku:
    -   Intuitive sudoku implementation 
    -   Relies on app skins and other cosmetics for revenue instead of advertisements 

### Spot Hero:
    -   Allows users to reserve a parking spot at paid lots 
    -   Can use Apple Pay as form of payment 

### App Idea:
    -   Build on Focus Keeper's functionality by adding a KanBan board to track tasks, similar to Trello
    -   Implement a non-ads based revenue generator, namely in the form of cosmetics for the app
    -   Encourage users to open the app and be productive with a streak system

## Notes

The app was simple to build, the largest hurdle was becoming familiar with Xcode's layout and UIKit as a whole.
